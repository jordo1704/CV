    <td><p>I am very enthusiastic when it comes to software development and testing. <br>As a tester in an Agile development team I work closely with developers. This, and my exposure to test automation here and in my previous job has really made me want to get much more involved in development. <br>I feel my exposure to code and the Agile SDLC, and my natural curiosity and desire to learn new things, along with my good testing skills, would make me a good fit for most environments.

<br>I have been creating my own websites (personal projects) and in doing so have completed a course in Bootstrap 4 and bootcamp for php developer, I am now moving onto my intermediate JavaScript course

      <h4>Automation Engineer/QA Analyst</h4>
      <h5>JB Global</h5>
      <h5>October 2019 - Present</h5>
      <p>Working for JB Global I have been given the space to develop my existing skills and push myself further.<br>
      . I am the sole automation engineer, using PHP to build from scratch and maintain JB Global’s automation suite. <br>
    As well as the automation suite and the odd manual testing, I have also been given the opportunity to help with development (fixing small bugs/small amendments to code) and have been given the authority to perform code reviews on certain projects<br>
  I have used a variety of tools whilst in my occupation including but not limited to Jira, Bitbucket, Brackets, phpStorm and more.</p>

      <br><h4>QA Tester</h4>
      <h5>Neptune Home</h5>
      <h5>April 2017 - October 2019</h5>
      <p>
          Whilst working as the sole software tester for Neptune Home I was tasked with working alongside the development and project management teams to start work on the early lifecycles for new projects, help write up/decide on what users want for the specifications and then test all the way through to the release.<br>
          Some of the tools I have used whilst being at Neptune are Leankit which is a great Kanban board that I rely on to manage the large volume of stories I have going across the board. I use GitKraken for checking out all projects and then ISS and VS for deployment/release which is run once a week and VS for my automation suite.<br>
          Neptune release on a Continuous Integration which is either weekly or bi-weekly.<br>
          <br>Main responsibilities:
          <uo>
              <li>Generation of test plans, test results and release documentation in line with company’s quality management system</li>
              <li>Perform manual functional, integration, regression, performance and occasionally user acceptance testing (with internal users and stakeholders across Neptune departments)</li>
              <li>Log and review issues found during testing and report them to the relevant parties</li>
              <li>Help to identify and implement QA process improvements</li>
              <li>Direct contact with internal developers and external suppliers to raise defects and retest their fixes</li>
              <li>Liaising and working with colleagues from all Neptune departments throughout full product lifecycle</li>
              <li>Create and maintain Automation Suite.</li>
          </uo><br>
          I have also taken on extra responsibilities such as being part of the Neptune Social Team which means I plan all IT team building (both in and out of the business) and I have helped the Support Team on a number of occasions (out of hours) to help bring down their backlog.

      <h5>TM Group</h5>
      <h5>May 2016 - April 2017</h5>
      <p>
          Working for this leading supplier of software and services to the property market, I was employed to support an innovative new web-based estate agency system.<br>
          My responsibilities:<br>
My duties included working closely with the development team as the primary tester of the software. As such I was responsible for testing all new functionality, creating and maintaining the regression suite and providing feedback to the project manager and product owners on possible improvements to the system and any bugs found during testing.<br>
          I also provided testing support on other major systems and have written regression suites for TM’s conveyancing Quotes web application and Portfolio web application.<br>
          In addition to functional testing I’ve also performed cross-browser testing and most recently I have had the opportunity to work with the QA Lead to start automating the manual regression suites.
